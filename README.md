## 📌 Problem Statement

We addressed the challenge: *“Decentralized Academic Credential Verification”*  
Traditional academic credential verification systems are slow, manual, and vulnerable to fraud. Institutions rely heavily on third-party agencies for verification, leading to inefficiencies and high costs. Employers often face delays or uncertainty when validating a candidate's credentials.

## 💡 Our Solution

**Project Name:** EduCred

EduCred is a decentralized platform that allows educational institutions and students to issue, store, and verify academic certificates on the blockchain. Certificates are minted as NFTs and stored via IPFS for tamper-proof, easily shareable, and instantly verifiable academic records. Employers and institutions can verify credentials without third-party involvement, ensuring speed, security, and trust.
